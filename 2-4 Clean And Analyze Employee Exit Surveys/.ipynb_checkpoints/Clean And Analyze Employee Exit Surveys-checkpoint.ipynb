    "In this project, we will work on exit surveys of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutes in Australia. Datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) for TAFE and [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) for DETE.\n",

    "We aim to answer to questions below:\n",
    "- Was dissatisfaction the reason people who worked at the institute for a short time to quit their jobs? What is the conditon with long-term employees?\n",
    "- Are young employees leaving because they are not satisfied? What about older ones?\n",

    "We will combine the two datasets to answer the questions. Although the two institutes have the same survey format, they contain different questions.\n",
